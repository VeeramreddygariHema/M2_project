The main objective of this project is to measure the distance between the object/obstacle and the blind person. In this project we are using Ultrasonics sensor. Ultrasonic Sensor sends out a sound wave signal at a frequency above the range of human hearing. Like ultrasonic sensor there are many others, we can use a transducer to transmit a pulse and to receive the echo. The Sensor determines the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulses.
